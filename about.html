<section class="section"><div class="container grid-2"><div class="panel fade-in-up"><h2 class="title-lg neon-underline">Our Origin</h2><p class="text">Some ideas appear suddenly. Others grow in silence — waiting for the right moment, the right courage, and the right people.</p><p class="text"><strong>LOGIXTREME belongs to the second kind.</strong></p><p class="text">My name is <strong>Mário Carvalho Santos</strong>, a 25-year-old creator fuelled by technology, ambition, and the instinct to build something that goes beyond the ordinary. For more than three years, the vision behind LOGIXTREME lived in the back of my mind — not as a dream, but as a blueprint for something bigger. Something bold. Something the tech community had not yet experienced in this form.</p><p class="text">And now, the time has come to bring it to life. The idea took form with my close colleague and friend, <strong>Jonathan de Sousa</strong>. Both of us work as content moderators for a major tech company — a space where precision, logic, and digital culture merge every day. Outside of our profession, we share a passion just as strong: building PCs, maintaining hardware, and competing in the worlds we create on screen.</p></div><div class="panel fade-in-up delay-1"><h2 class="title-lg neon-underline">A New Type of Tech Space</h2><p class="text">LOGIXTREME is more than a store. More than a lab. More than an arcade. It is a 150m² hybrid tech arena designed for enthusiasts, gamers, builders, and dreamers. A place where technology isn’t just sold — it’s experienced.</p><p class="text">Customers can build their own custom PC, guided by specialists who understand performance at its core. From high-end rigs to budget-optimized builds, LOGIXTREME empowers everyone to craft their perfect machine.</p><div class="chips"><div class="chip">Workshop</div><div class="chip">Lab</div><div class="chip">Marketplace</div></div></div></div></section>
<section class="section alt-bg fade-in-up"><div class="container centered"><h2 class="title-lg neon-text">The LOGIXTREME Spirit</h2><p class="text max-600 centered">LOGIXTREME is built on three pillars: <strong>Technology</strong> — not as a product but as a lifestyle. <strong>Experience</strong> — every customer becomes part of the environment. <strong>Community</strong> — a space created by enthusiasts, for enthusiasts.</p></div></section>
